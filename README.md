# Pytorch Implementation of "Zero-Shot" Super-Resolution using Deep Internal Learning  (ZSSR)
### modified form  Assaf Shocher

----------
All augmentations are included. The principle of this pytorch version is "changing as little as possible", so most of the code is from Assaf Shocher. Thanks Assaf, I really love this paper:) 
----------
I have added a cuda flag at config.py. If you want to use cpu, pls set it to False.

# "Zero-Shot" Super-Resolution using Deep Internal Learning  (ZSSR)
### Official implementation for paper by: Assaf Shocher, Nadav Cohen, Michal Irani

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06087  
Project page: http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/zssr/ (See our results and visual comparison to other methods)

**Accepted CVPR'18**

----------
This current provided version of ZSSR actually achieves better results on benchmarks than indicated in the paper.  
For example, when current version is applied to 'Set14' without use of gradual SR increments, it achieves slightly higher PSNR than specified in the paper (when 6 gradual increments are applied). When gradual increments similar to those specified in the paper are applied, then +0.3dB is obtained.

# Usage:

## Quick usage on your data:  
(First, put your desired low-res files in ```<ZSSR_path>/test_data/```.  
Results will be generated to ```<ZSSR_path>/results/<name_date>/```.  
data must be *.png type)
```
python run_ZSSR.py
```

## General usage:
```
python run_ZSSR.py <config> <gpu-optional>
```
While ``` <config> ``` is an instance of configs.Config class (at configs.py) or 0 for default configuration.  
Please see configs.py to determine configuration (data paths, scale-factors etc.)  
``` <gpu-optional> ``` is an optional parameter to determine how to use available GPUs (see next section).

For using given kernels, you must have a kernels for each input file and each scale-factor named as follows:  
``` <inpu_file_name>_<scale_factor_ind_starting_0>.mat ```  
Kernels are MATLAB files containing a matrix named "Kernel".  

If gound-truth exists and true-error monitoring is wanted, then ground truth should be named as follows:  
``` <inpu_file_name>_gt.png ```  


## GPU options
Run on a specific GPU:
```
python run_ZSSR.py <config> 0
```
Run multiple files efficiently on multiple GPUs.  
**Before using this option make sure you update in the configs.py file the ***python_path*** parameter**
```
python run_ZSSR.py <config> all
```

## Quick usage examples (applied on provided data examples):  
Usage example to test 'Set14', Gradual SR (~0.3dB better results, 6x Runtime)
```
python run_ZSSR.py X2_GRADUAL_IDEAL_CONF
```
Usage example to test 'Set14' (Non-Gradual SR)
```
python run_ZSSR.py X2_ONE_JUMP_IDEAL_CONF
```
Visualization while running (Recommended for one image, interactive mode, for debugging)
```
python run_ZSSR.py X2_IDEAL_WITH_PLOT_CONF
```
Applying a given kernel
```
python run_ZSSR.py X2_GIVEN_KERNEL_CONF
```
Run on a real image
```
python run_ZSSR.py X2_REAL_CONF
```

Example kernels were generated from the input images using:
